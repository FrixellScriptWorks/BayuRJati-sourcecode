# school-tasks
This is repository for collecting my school assignment, thought, and computation. Primarily uses C++ and/or Python, but other languages will be added too. If you like it, you can use this source as you wish. But at least, inform me about something.

Usually, the code is very simple to understand and sometimes you can use it separately too. It means that you can move just one function into your own code, or use it like a library. It's your call.

Please, raise the issue flag if you find troubles/bugs with it. Make sure you read the instruction in the code first.
